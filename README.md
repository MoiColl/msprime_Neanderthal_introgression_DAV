# Jupyther Notebook with msprime simulations and Markdown tricks

I created a Jupyther Notebook as example of:
- msprime Simulation of Neanderthal Introgression to non-Africans
- Cool Markdown triks
  - Links for figures and sections (Contents)
  - Image (arrow) that returns you to the contents
  - Ataching images
- bash and R majic cells in a Python Kernel

Hope is useful!
